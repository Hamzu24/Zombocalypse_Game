# Zombocalypse_Game

My final Javascript game before I moved onto Java & OOP, created when I was wround 14.

Controls:</br>
- Click to shoot</br>
- WASD or Arrow Keys to move</br>
- "Q" to swap to your secondary</br>
- 1, 2 and 3 to use grenades that are equipped</br>
The remaining controls should be self explanatory

Important: In the testing floor menus for guns, zombies and grenades, use the arrow keys to make your selection
